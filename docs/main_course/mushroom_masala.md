### Ingredients

- 1/3 cup raw cashews, soaked in hot water for 10-15 minutes and then blended to a paste with 1/4 cup water
1.5 tablespoon oil, 22 ml, use oil of choice, I used avocado oil
1 medium red onion, chopped
1 inch ginger, chopped
3-4 large garlic cloves, chopped
3 medium tomatoes, pureed or use a can of tomatoes
3/4 teaspoon coriander powder
1/4 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/4 teaspoon red chili powder/cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
8 oz white mushrooms, sliced
2 small potatoes, 200 grams, cut into 1/2 to 1 inch pieces
1 cup water, 8 oz
1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed
1-2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
small lemon, juice of

### Instructions

1. Soak 1/3 cup of cashews in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. Then puree in a blender to a paste along with 1/4 cup water. Set it aside.

Press the saute button on the Instant Pot. Once it displays hot, add the oil and then add the chopped onion, ginger and garlic. Cook for around 3 minutes or until the onions are soft and light golden in color.

Add the pureed tomatoes or use a can of crushed tomatoes. Scrape the bottom and deglaze the pot.

Add the all the spices- coriander powder, garam masala, smoked paprika, turmeric and chili powder. Also add the sugar and salt. Stir to combine.

Add in the sliced mushrooms and potato. Toss to combine with the masala. Add in 1 cup of water.

Close the pot with the lid and press the manual or pressure cook button. Cook on high pressure for 2 mins, with the pressure valve in the sealing position.Let the pressure release naturally for 2 minutes and then do a quick pressure release.

Open the pot and press the saute button again. Stir in the prepared cashew paste and mix.

Add in the kasuri methi and cilantro. Simmer the curry for 2 to 3 minutes, the curry will thicken.

Add lemon juice and mix. Serve mushroom curry over rice or quinoa!

Notes: 

Curry will thicken as it cools down as there are cashews in there. So do add 1 cup water, it might seem like a lot but its not.
I cooked on high pressure for 2 minutes because I wanted a bite to my mushrooms. If you want them soft, do 4 to 5 minutes on high pressure.
You can follow the same recipe for a traditional pressure cooker. Just cook for 4-5 whistles on high heat and then let the pressure release naturally. Once the veggies are cooked, then add the cashew paste, cilantro, kasuri methi and lemon juice.
You may also add green peas to this curry.
