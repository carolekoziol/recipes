### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 bell peppers, sliced lengthwise.
- 1 package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed (or fresh chopped collard greens or kale)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch fresh ginger, minced or grated
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)
- 1 and 1/2 cups diced tomatoes (equal to 1 14-oz. can)
- 1 14-oz. can of coconut milk
- 3 cups cooked chickpeas (equal to 2 cans; drain and rinse before using)
- 1 lime or lemon, juiced
- chopped fresh cilantro for serving

### Instructions

1. In a large pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. 
2. Add the onion, bell peppers, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and ginger; stir and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant. 
4. Stir in the spices and the remaining salt. Cook for 1 minute.
5. Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3-5 minutes or until the tomatoes are starting to break down. 
6. Stir in the coconut milk and chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
7. Add spinach and allow to wilt.
8. Add in the lime juice. Season to taste with additional spices and salt.
9. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
10. Serve over rice

Can be served as it is or over rice/quinoa/barley.

### Notes
To add hearty vegetables such as sweet potatoes, squash or cauliflower: 

- Cut the veggies into bite-sized pieces. 
- Add them after step 2 but before step 3 (before adding the garlic and ginger)
- Stir-fry for a couple of minutes until the vegetable is softened a little bit.
