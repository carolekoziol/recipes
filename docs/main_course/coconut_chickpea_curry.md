### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 1 inch fresh ginger, minced or grated
- 1 tablespoon garam masala
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)
- 1 and 1/2 cups diced tomatoes (equal to 1 14-oz. can; drain before using, but reserve the liquid in case the curry is too dry)
- 1 and 1/2 cups full-fat coconut milk (equal to 1 14-oz. can)
- 1 and 3/4 cups cooked chickpeas (equal to 1 16-oz. can; drain and rinse before using)
- 1 lime or lemon, juiced
- chopped fresh cilantro for serving

#### Rice

- 1 cup white rice
- 1 and 1/2 cups broth (or water)

### Instructions

1. In a medium pot, boil the broth (or water) over high heat.
1. Add the rice, and stir well.
1. Cover the pot, and turn off the heat (if using an electric stovetop. If using gas or induction, reduce the heat to minimum). The rice will be ready at around the same time as the curry.
1. Meanwhile, in a large pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. 
1. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
1. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and ginger; stir and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant. 
1. Stir in the spices and the remaining salt. Cook for 1 minute.
1. Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3-5 minutes or until the tomatoes are starting to break down. 
1. Stir in the coconut milk and chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
1. Add in the lime juice. Season to taste with additional spices and salt.
1. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
1. Serve over rice

### Recipe Notes
TO ADD HEARTY VEGETABLES LIKE SWEET POTATO OR CAULIFLOWER: Cut the veggies into bite-sized pieces, and add them after the initial step of cooking the onion, but before adding the garlic and ginger. Stir-fry for a couple of minutes until the vegetable is softened a little bit. It can then finish cooking when the chickpea coconut curry is brought to a boil and simmered.

TO ADD QUICK-COOKING VEGETABLES LIKE SPINACH: After simmering the chickpea curry, turn off the heat, stir in the spinach, and cover the pan. Remove the lid after 2 minutes, or when the spinach is wilted to your liking.
