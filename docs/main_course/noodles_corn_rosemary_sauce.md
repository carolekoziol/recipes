** Prep time: 5 minutes || Cook time: 15 minutes minutes || Serving: 4 || Rating 10/10 **

### Ingredients

- 1 lbs fresh rice noodles or fresh fettuccine
- 1 teaspoon olive oil, plus oil for coating the noodle
- proteins (225g of uncooked ground meat or 500g cooked marinated tofu, 1 inch cube chopped)
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 tablespoon rosemary, minced
- 1 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- 2 cups of broths
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold broth/water
- salt and pepper, to taste

** For serving **

- green onions, diced for topping (optional)
- hot pepper sauce or sweet chili sauce (optional)

### Instructions

1. If using fresh noodles, break them up by placing in a colander, running hot water over them and, if necessary, separating the strands with your fingers. 
	- If using dry pasta, boil them in water until cooked. Drain and coat with a little oil.
2. In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat for 30 seconds. Add onions and cook until translucent. 
3. If using meat:
	- Add the ground meat, rosemary and mix well. Saut√© and stir often until meat is cooked. Drain excess fat. 
4. Add the corn and broth. Bring it to a boil. 
5. Add dissolved cornstarch and stir until the sauce begins to thicken.
6. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
7. Add noodles, mix well and heat until the noodles are soft, pliable and heated through (about 2-3 minutes). 
	- The dish will benefit from standing for a few minutes with the heat off; be careful not to leave it too long, or the noodles will become a starchy mass.
8. Adjust seasoning.
8. If using marinade tofu: 
	- Add the [marinated tofu](../basics/marinating_tofu.md) cubes in the noodles dish and mix.

Top with green onions and serve with hot pepper or sweet chili sauce. 

Enjoy!
