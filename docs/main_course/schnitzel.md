** Prep time: 20 minutes || Cook time: 25 minutes || Serving: 4 || Rating X/10 **

### Ingredients

- 4 boneless pork steaks/chops, chicken breast, or veal steak
- olive oil
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour combined with 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

** Options for accompanying sauces (see below) **

- Brown Mushroom Gravy (Jägerschnitzel “hunter schnitzel”)
- Gypsy Sauce (Zesty bell peppers) (Zigeunerschnitzel “gypsy schnitzel”)

### Instructions

1. Pound the meat between two sheets of plastic wrap with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until 1/4 inch thick.  Lightly sprinkle both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
2. Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dredge the tenderized meat in the flour, then the egg, and then the breadcrumbs. Coating both sides and all edges at each stage. 
	- Don't press the breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs.
	- Don't let the schnitzel sit in the coating or they will not be as crispy once fried - fry immediately. 
3. Heat the oil to 330F (not hotter or the Schnitzel will burn before the meat is done, not lower or the Schnitzel will absorb the oil and be greasy).  Use just enough oil so that the Schnitzels "swim" in it.  Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly to a plate lined with paper towels.


Serve immediately topped with an accompanying sauce or gravy with a side of spaetzle, french fries or swabian potato salad and a leafy green or cucumber salad. Avoid completely drenching the Schnitzel with gravy so that much of the Schnitzel remains crispy.


## Accompanying gravy or sauces for the schnitzel

### 1. Brown Mushroom Gravy (Jägerschnitzel “hunter schnitzel”)

[Original Recipe](https://www.daringgourmet.com/best-brown-mushroom-gravy-from-scratch/)

- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme (optional, to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

- Optional: For a creamy gravy, add a few tablespoons of heavy cream at the end

Notes: If using this gravy for German Jägerschnitzel and you prefer a more basic, traditional gravy, omit the balsamic vinegar and thyme.

** Instructions **

1. Melt the butter (or bacon grease, lard, beef dripping)  in a pan over medium-high heat and fry the onions until beginning to brown.  Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
2. Add the mushrooms and cook 5-7 minutes or until golden and the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated.
3. Add the unsalted butter and melt. Add the flour, stir to combine and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring continually.
4. Add the beef broth, vinegar, thyme, sugar, salt and pepper.  Whisk continually until the gravy is thickened.  Cover and simmer on low, stirring occasionally, for 5-10 minutes. 
5. Add salt and pepper to taste.  If you prefer the gravy thinner add a little more water (or heavy cream if using)
