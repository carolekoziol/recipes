### Instructions

1. Add oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

	- If use tofu, either pan fry in a skillet or bake it at 375F until golden.
3. Saute cabbage, mushrooms, onions and garlic for approximately 10 minutes. Season well with salt & pepper. 
	- if you prefer the cabbage to be crunchy: follow step 3.
