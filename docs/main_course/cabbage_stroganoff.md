### Ingredients


1. 14 oz Cabbage, thinly sliced
1. 8 oz Mushrooms, sliced
1. 12 oz Protein (e.g. chicken, sliced tofu, TVP, or crumbled tempeh)
1. 1 onion, thinly sliced
1. 2 cloves garlic, minced
1. 3 Tbsp butter
1. 1 Tbsp flour
1. 1/4 cup white wine
1. 1 cup beef flavored vegetable broth
1. 1 Tbsp dijon mustard
1. 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1. 1/3 cup sour cream (substitutions: coconut milk, milk + tapioca + lemon juice, or hummus + lemon juice)
1. 2 Tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
1. Salt & pepper to taste


### Steps


1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. 
1. Saute cabbage, mushrooms, onions and garlic for approximately 10 minutes. Season well with salt & pepper. *(Cabbage will still be crunchy with this method; if you prefer a softer cabbage, saute it alone for 5 minutes before adding mushrooms, onions and garlic.)
1. Mix in plant-sourced protein, and fry for 1 to minutes to heat through.
1. Add white wine and allow alcohol to cook off, approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
1. Sprinkle flour over vegetables, mix in and continue to cook for 2 minutes.
1. Add broth, dijon mustard and worchestire. Cook until broth thickened, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
1. Reduce heat to low. Mix in sour cream. Cook until heated through.
1. Remove from heat. Stir in chopped parsley before serving.
