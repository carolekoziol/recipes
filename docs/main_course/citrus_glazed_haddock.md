	- red bell pepper
	- vinegar powder 
	- green bell pepper
	- sunflower oil
	- paprika 
	- turmeric
	- cayenne pepper

### Instructions

1. Cook the rice: 
	- In a medium pot, combine the rice, 1/2 the demi-glace and 1 1/4 cups water (or as instructed); season with 1/3 of the spice blend and salt and pepper. 
	- Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer, 17 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. 
	- Fluff the cooked rice with a fork and set aside in a warm spot. 
2. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice and brown sugar; stir to combine until the brown sugar has dissolved. 
3. Make the carambola salsa:
	- In a large bowl, combine the carambola, cherry tomatoes, white bottom of the scallion, up to 1/2 the citrus juice mixture (to taste) and up to 1/2 the cilantro (to taste). 
	- Add a drizzle of oil; season with 1/2 the remaining spice blend, salt and pepper to taste. Toss well. 
4. Cook & glaze the haddock:
	- In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of oil on medium-high. 
	- Thoroughly pat the haddock fillets dry with paper towel; season with the remaining spice blend, salt and pepper. 
	- Add the haddock to the pan and cook, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side, until golden brown. Flip the haddock; add the remaining demi-glace, remaining lime juice mixture and 1 tablespoon water. 
	- Cook, spooning the sauce over the fish, 1 to 2 minutes, until the fish is glazed and cooked through. 
5. To the pot of rice, add as much citrus zest and cilantro/dill to taste. Stir to combine thoroughly. 

To serve: put the cilantro rice onto your plate. Top with the glazed haddock and carambola salsa. Garnish the dish with as much green top of the scallion to taste and the reserved carambola stars, if desired. Bon app√©tit!
