### Notes 

** THE FULL BRISKET WILL NEED TO BE COOKED PRIOR TO MAKING BURNT ENDS **

- After burnt ends have cooked for an hour and you unwrap the foil, feel free to drain some of the excess juices in the foil pan

- Make sure the burnt ends render when you give them a squeeze.

- Aim to have them be a little sticky.
