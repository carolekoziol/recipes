### Instructions

### - Sushi Rice

1. 1 cup of sushi rice make around 3 rolls (18 pieces).
2. Wash the rice, and cook it for the recommended time with a little salt added.
3. When rice has cooked and is fully drained.
	- When the rice is boilling, turn off the stove and cover the pot. 
	- It should take about 16 minutes for the rice to be ready. 
4. Add 1/4 cup of rice vinegar, and 2 teaspoons of maple syrup to rice and mix thoroughly.
	- The rice will now become even more sticky and clumpy. Add more rice vinegar if you feel you need to or if you want a more intense flavour. The rice should taste a slight bit tangy.
5. Let the rice cool as much as possible. 
	- If it's too hot, it will destroy your nori (seaweed sheets).
	
The finished sushi rice should have a similar texture to the rice below in the picture.

### 1. Uramaki (Inside-Out Sushi or California Rolls)

1. Place the nori on the rolling mat, but always keep a sheet of wrapping wrap on the mat (as the inside-out maki sushi is quite messy).

2. Cover the whole nori sheet with a thin layer of rice, just enough to cover the sheet until you can’t see it through the rice.

3. Make sure the rice is firmly pressed down onto the seaweed, and then, with your hand on top of the rice, turn the sheet around so that the rice is now placed on top of the wrapping wrap.

4. Place your choice of filling (1 to 3 filling choices) about ¼ of the way up from the bottom of the nori.

5. To roll, lift up the bottom part of the bamboo sushi mat and roll the rice covered nori over the fillings you’ve just placed on the rice. While doing this, make sure to keep just enough pressure on the bamboo mat with one hand (to make sure sushi is firm), and pull the bamboo mat with the other hand. Make sure the wrapping wrap doesn’t get incorporated into the sushi.
This maki sushi roll should look like the sushi log.

6. Optonal: Spread sesame seeds all over the outside of the sushi, as much as you want, then sprinkle some paprika or tobiko over it for colour. 

7. Cut the sushi slices using a wet, sharp knife. Wet this knife before cutting each slice. 
	- If you don't get it wet, the rice will stick to the knife and end up mutilating your sushi!
