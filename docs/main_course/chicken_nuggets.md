#### Ingredients

- 2 Whole Chicken Breasts, bones removed
- 2+ Chicken Livers, from whole chicken (optional)
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon Parsley flakes
- 1/4 teaspoon Onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon Pepper
- 2 Eggs, beaten
- 1 to 1 1/2 cups arrowroot powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Pinch black pepper
- 1/4 cup melted fat (oil/butter/lard/tallow) (if baking) or frying oil (if frying)

#### Instructions

1. Use a meat grinder to process the chicken breasts and livers into ground meat into a "paste".
	- You have to passed the ground meat twice or three time through the meat grinder before it become a paste.
	- Really work the meat and mash it otherwise it will become a meatball instead of a nugget.
2. Add seasoning and mix well.
3. Roll meat paste into nugget size pieces (half the size of a golf ball) and place on a baking sheet.
4. In one medium side dish, mix in the arrowroot flour, salt and pepper.

6. Dip nuggets in egg mix and then into the arrowroot flour mix. Coat well and place back on cookie sheet. Continue until all the chicken nuggets are breaded.
	- If you would like to freeze the chicken nuggets, do so at this point. Place cookie sheet in freezer until nuggets are frozen on the outside (for about 45 minutes) and place the nuggets in freezer friendly container.
7. Cook the nuggets:
	- Bake: 
		1. Preheat the oven at 350 F.
		2. Spread some oil/butter/lard/tallow over chicken nuggets. 
		3. Bake until they are cooked through (about 1 hour). Flip nuggets half way through cooking. 
			- For frozed nuggets, it may need more time to cook. 
	- Frying:

		2. Place the nuggets in the fryer for approx 10 minutes, turning once. Don't overcrowd the fryer at this point!
		3. Take the nuggets out of the fryer and leave on a paper towel to drain for a couple of minutes.
