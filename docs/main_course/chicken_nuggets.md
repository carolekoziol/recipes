### Ingredients

- 2 Whole Chicken Breasts, bones removed
- 2+ Chicken Livers, from whole chicken (optional)
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon Parsley flakes
- 1/4 teaspoon Onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon Pepper
- 2 Eggs, beaten
- 1 to 1 1/2 cups arrowroot powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Pinch black pepper
- 1/4 cup melted fat (oil/butter/lard/tallow) (if baking) or frying oil (if frying)

### Instructions

1. Use a meat grinder to process the chicken breasts and livers into ground meat into a "paste".
2. Add seasoning and mix well.
3. Roll meat paste into nugget size pieces (smaller than a golf ball) and place on a baking sheet.
4. In one medium side dish, mix in the arrowroot flour, salt and pepper. 
5. In the second medium side dish, add beaten eggs.
6. Dip nuggets in egg mix and then into the arrowroot flour mix. Coat well and place back on cookie sheet. Continue until all the chicken nuggets are breaded.
	- If you would like to freeze the chicken nuggets, do so at this point. Place cookie sheet in freezer until nuggets are frozen on the outside (for about 45 minutes) and place the nuggets in freezer friendly container.
7. Cook the nuggets:
	- Bake: 
		1. Preheat the oven at 350 F.
		2. Spread some oil/butter/lard/tallow over chicken nuggets. 
		3. Bake until they are cooked through (about 1 hour). Flip nuggets half way through cooking. 
			- For frozed nuggets, it may need more time to cook. 
	- Frying: 
		1. Preheat the frying oil. 
		2. Add and cook the nuggets until they are done.
