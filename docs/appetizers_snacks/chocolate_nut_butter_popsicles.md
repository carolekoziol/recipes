** Prep time: 10 minutes|| Freeze time: 6-8 hours || Serving: 10-12 popsicles (This is the right yield for the silicone molds) **

### Ingredients

- 4 medium bananas, sliced and frozen
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons unsalted nut butter (peanut, almond, hazelnut, etc.)
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil

### Instructions

1. Add bananas and almond milk into a blender. Blend until smooth. 
2. Add nut butter. Blend until smooth.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together cocoa powder, maple syrup and coconut oil to make chocolate syrup. Whisk until smooth and shiny, like melted chocolate.

5. Pour this mixture into a popsicle mold, leaving about 1/4 inch of space to allow the mixture to expand in the freezer. 
6. Freeze for 6-8 hours.
