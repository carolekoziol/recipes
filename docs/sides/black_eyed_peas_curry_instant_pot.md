** Prep time: 10 minutes || Cook time: 20 minutes || Serving: 5 || Rating 9/10 **

### Ingredients

- 1 cup dried black eyed peas , soaked in water for about 1-2 hours (see notes below)
- 2 cups water
- 3 dried curry leaves
- 1/8 teasp mustard seeds
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/2 medium white onion , finely chopped
- 2.5 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 3 teaspoons maple sugar/honey
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- chili powder, to taste (optional)
- olive oil
- salt
- fresh cilantro , finely chopped

### Instructions

1. Select the Saute button (normal) on the Instant Pot and add 2 teasp cooking oil. 

Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant.

Add the onions and garlic. Saute until fragrant and the onions start to become translucent. Be sure not to burn either. If you see this happening add more oil or turn down the saute heat. 

Quickly add the tomato paste, ground cumin, and ground coriander. Combine and cook for a minute mixing frequently.

Drain the soaked black eyed peas and add them into the Instant Pot.

Mix in the water, turmeric, chili powder (if using), jaggery, fresh lemon juice, and 1 teasp salt.

Close the Instant Pot lid, select the Pressure Cook button to cook on high. Set the timer for about 13-15 minutes (be sure to turn the 'keep warm' button off unless enjoying immediately).

When the time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally.

Once the pressure has been released, remove the lid, and press the Saute (normal-low) button again on the Instant Pot. The black eyed peas should be fully cooked.

Simmer for a few more minutes until the curry becomes thick.

Add salt to taste. Also feel free to adjust the amount of lemon juice and jaggery as needed. 

Turn the Instant Pot off. Add freshly chopped cilantro and serve hot as is, over cooked rice, or alongside some Naan or fresh roti! 

### Notes
Stove-top Method - Follow steps 1-6 above using 3 cups of water. Bring the curry to a low simmer, partially cover, and allow it to cook for 30-45 minutes or until the black eyed peas become tender and the curry is at the desired thickness. Then continue to follow again at Step 10 above.

Black Eyed Peas - If you are using pre-cooked black eyed peas, add 2.5 cups cooked. Follow steps 1-6 above using only 1.5 cups water. Simmer for about 20 minutes, and then continue to follow again at Step 10 above.
