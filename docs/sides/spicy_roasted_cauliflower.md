### Ingredients

- 1 head cauliflower, bite-size florets
- 3 tablespoons butter/olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar (honey, maple, cane sugar)
- salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon hot paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 F.
2. In a medium pot over medium heat, melt the butter/heat the olive oil. 
3. Remove the pan from the heat and mix in the sugar, salt, pepper, hot paprika, sweet paprika, cayenne, turmeric, and cinnamon. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely. 
4. Add the cauliflower into the pan. Toss to coat with the spicy sauce as evenly as possible.
