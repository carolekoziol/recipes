** Total time: 30 minutes || Serving: 6  || Rate: 8/10**

### Instructions

1. Large saucepan over high heat | Cooking thermometer, optional | Pestle and mortar | Line a dinner plate with paper towels

Pour the vegetable oil into the large saucepan so that it comes no more than two-thirds up the side of the pan | Heat the oil to 350°F, or until a wooden spoon dipped into the oil sizzles around the edges

Meanwhile, peel and very finely slice the onions and put them into a big bowl | Peel the ginger by scraping off the skin with a spoon and finely chop | Rip the stem from the chili, cut it in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds if you prefer a milder flavor, then finely chop and add to the pan | Roughly chop the cilantro leaves | Add the ginger, chili, and cilantro to the bowl | Crush the coriander seeds and cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar or the end of a rolling pin and add them to the bowl | Add the chickpea flour, garam masala, water, and a generous pinch of salt and mix until everything is well combined and covered with a wet sticky batter

Divide the mixture into 6 and use your hands to mold it into patties around 3 ½ inches wide and no more than 1/3 inch thick | Use a metal spoon to carefully lower 2 of the patties into the hot oil and cook them for about 5 minutes, flipping them over halfway | Remove the patties when they are golden and crisp and transfer to the plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil | Repeat with the remaining patties

While the bhajis are frying, split the burger buns open and spread the bottom halves with vegan mayonnaise | Thinly slice the cucumber and tomato | Halve and carefully pit the avocado by tapping the pit firmly with the heel of a knife so that it lodges in the pit, then twist and remove the pit | Run a spoon around the inside of the avocado skin to scoop out the flesh, then slice finely

To serve the bhaji burgers, lay a few lettuce leaves on the bottom of the burger buns and place the burgers on top | Spread a little mango chutney on top of each, followed by slices of tomato, avocado, and cucumber | Break up the pappadum and sprinkle it over the top before closing the buns
