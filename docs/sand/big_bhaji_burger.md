1. Crush the coriander seeds and cumin seeds with a pestle and mortar or the end of a rolling pin and add them to the bowl 
1. Add the chickpea flour, garam masala, water, and a generous pinch of salt and mix until everything is well combined and covered with a wet sticky batter
1. Divide the mixture into 6 and use your hands to mold it into patties around 3 ½ inches wide and no more than 1/3 inch thick 
1. Use a metal spoon to carefully lower 2 of the patties into the hot oil and cook them for about 5 minutes, flipping them over halfway 
1. Remove the patties when they are golden and crisp and transfer to the plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil 
1. Repeat with the remaining patties

Serve the bhaji on a bun with the topping(s) of your choice.
