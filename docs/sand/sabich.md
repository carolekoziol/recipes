### Ingredients

- 1 large white potato
- 1 eggplant (medium size), sliced
- 4 hard-cooked eggs, sliced

Sabich's mixture: 

- 3 tablespoons olive oil (plus more for brushing)
- 1 cucumber (peeled, halved, seeded and cut into /2-inch dice)
- 1 tomato, diced
- 1 jalapeño, minced (optional)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons cilantro, chopped (optional)
- 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- Salt and pepper

Toppings:

- 4 pita breads
- hummus
- 1/4 cup tahini (at room temperature)
- 4 dill pickles, sliced

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°. 
1. In a small saucepan, cover the potato with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Cook over moderate heat until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool, then peel  and slice the potato. Season the potato slices with salt.
2. Meanwhile, arrange the eggplant slices on a rimmed baking sheet and brush both sides with olive oil. Season with salt and bake for about 10 minutes, until browned and tender.
3. In a large bowl, add the cucumber, tomato, jalapeño, garlic, cilantro and parsley. Toss with the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
4. Separate each side of the pita (like a shawarma). On one side of the pita, spread the hummus, a little of tahini over it. Layer the potato slices, eggplant, egg and sabich's mixture and pickles. Then roll it like with a shawarma or soft shell tacos.

Serve warm.
