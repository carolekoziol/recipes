### Notes

Veggie to Flour Ratio: The amount of flour you need may be depended on how much liquid remains in your veggies, size of eggs and also personal preference. You could start with 1/4 cup (35g) and add more if needed. 

Egg Free: I have tested the recipe using flax eggs. They are more fragile to handle but held together to form fritters. 

Parmesan: Fresh parmesan should be used, not the ambient product you find in the pasta isle. :) Can be omitted to make dairy free.
