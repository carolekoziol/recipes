** Prep time: 60 minutes, plus 6 hours first proof and 3 hours second proof || Serving: 10 || Rating X/10 **

#### Ingredients

- 1900 grams of OO flour
- 1L water
- 150 grams of leftover pizza dough (or sourdough discard)
- 50 grams of salt
- 5 grams of fresh yeast 

#### Instructions

1. Place 760 grams of the OO flour in the corner of a wooden kneading trough (or wooden box or a bowl. In the opposite corner, slowly pour in the water.
2. Add the old dough and mix thoroughly until dissolved. Add the salt and again mix until dissolved. Constantly add the remaining flour until the mixture has a batter-like consistency. At this stage, crumble in the fresh yeast.
	- If you are making this recipe for the first time, you can replace the leftover dough with some ready-made pizza dough (defrosted if bought frozen) from the shop, but be sure to reserve some of this new batch of dough to improve the flavour next time you make it.
3. Keep mixing and adding 1140g of 00 flour until it is all used up, then knead for another 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and consistent. 
4. Cover and leave to prove for 6 hours at room temperature.
5. After this time, divide the dough into 250g portions. Fold and shape into balls, pulling into the centre like a mozzarella ball. Leave to rise for another 3 hours at room temperature.
6. Place some of the dough in a jar and keep for next time you make pizza â€“ you'll need 150g for every 2kg flour.

** Prep time: 10 minutes || Cook time: 7 minutes || Total time: 17 minutes  || Serving: 6 || Rating X/10 **

#### Ingredients

- 5 cups all purpose or 00 flour + some for dusting
- 1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 2 1/4 cups COLD water
- 1 tbs extra virgin olive oil

- toppings: 
     Caramelized onions
    Arrabiata Sauce
    Heirloom Tomatoes
    Fresh Basil
    Green Onions
    Smoked Mozzarella Cheese
    Sauteed Mushrooms
    Ricotta Meatballs

#### Instructions

1. In the bowl of your kitchen aid and using the paddle attachment mix the flour, sea salt and active dry yeast on low speed until all is incorporated then add the COLD water.
1. Switch to the dough hook and mix together on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom.
1. (If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry then add a bit more water).
1. After the 8 minutes have passed remove the dough from the kitchen aid and cut it into 6 pieces and form them into rounds. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tbs of extra virgin olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature and rise for 2 hours in a draft free area. ( I prefer the oven )
1. Place a pizza stone in the oven (place the rack near the top of the oven, as the broiler will be used to finish the pizza), and preheat as high as it will go for at least 45 minutes to one hour.
1. Sprinkle the counter with a little bit of flour, take one piece of dough and press down on it with your fingers until you have 1/2" thick circle or oval. Using your fists and knuckles start stretching the dough until 10" in diameter making sure not to tear it ( this should be easy since it is a small pie).
1. Dust your pizza peel (or a piece of cardboard) very well with semolina flour or corn meal and set your pizza dough on it making sure it slides easily when moved. Pour 2-3 tablespoons of the pizza sauce in the center and spread it around with the back of a spoon leaving 1 inch of space at the edges and making sure not to get any on the peel. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and add your favorite toppings. ( Don't add too many toppings, keep in mind this is a thin crust and a couple of toppings will suffice ).
1. Gently slide the pie on the preheated pizza stone in a hot 525 degree or more oven, and bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until golden brown on the edges. When making the breakfast pizza I find that the egg cooks perfectly in 6 minutes.
1. Turn the broiler to maximum, and allow the pizza to develop a nice charr.
1. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the basil and freshly grated parmigiano reggianno. Allow to rest for a few minute for the cheese to set.

- Hand Method
1. Pour the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast, salt and cold water and using a wooden spoon mix to combine well.
1. Sprinkle some flour on a work surface/kitchen counter and dump the pizza dough. Sprinkle some more flour on top and using your hand knead the dough for about 10 to 15 minutes until a smooth ball forms but still a little bit sticky on the bottom. Follow the steps above afterwards.


#### Recipe Notes
- Make sure to preheat your oven with the pizza stone on the top rack for at least 45 minutes, and finish cooking the pizza under the broiler for a nice charred touch.
- If topping with heirloom tomato slices, make sure to use the firm ones, otherwise the pizza would be watery. Thin firm slices is what you want.
