** Prep time: 2-4 hours || Cook time: 20 minutes || Serving: two 12" rounds baking sheets **

#### Ingredients

Note: This list is for regular-crust thickness. For thin-crusts divide the recipe in half and at step 8, bake it for 5 min.

- 2 cup sourdough discard 
- 1 cup warm water
- 5 cups All-Purpose Flour
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast

#### Instructions

1. Stir any liquid on top of your refrigerated starter back into it before measuring 1 cup into a large mixing bowl. Note: This is a good opportunity to feed the remainder of your starter, if necessary.

2. Add the warm water, flour, salt, yeast. Mix to combine, then knead for about 7 minutes in a mixer with the dough hook, until the dough wraps itself around the hook and cleans the side of the bowl.

3. Place the dough in a greased container, cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk. Depending on the vitality of your starter, this will take between 2 and 4 hours. For a faster rise, place the dough in a warm spot, or double the yeast.

4. Divide the dough in half, and shape each into a flattened disk. Drizzle two 12" round pizza pans with olive oil, and brush to coat the bottom. Place the dough in the pans, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes. After this rest, gently press the dough toward the edges of the pans. If it starts to shrink back, cover and let rest for 15 minutes before continuing.

6. Cover the pan(s) and let the dough rise until it's as thick as you like.

7. Towards the end of the rise time, preheat your oven to 450Â°F.

8. Bake the crust until it become partially cook (about 10 minutes). Then add the sauce and choice of toppings. Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melt (about 5 to 7 min.).

### Paleo Pizza Crust (Grain-Free & Dairy-Free)

** Prep time: 15 minutes || Cook time: 10 minutes || Serving: two 12" rounds baking sheets **

#### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 3/4 cup tapioca flour or arrowroot starch plus 2-3 tbsp more for spreading/kneading dough
- 6 tbsp coconut flour divided into 3 (first) and 3 (after adding the egg)
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 3/4 tsp sea salt
- 1/3 cup warm water
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 egg room temp, whisked

#### Instructions

Preheat your oven to 450 degrees and line a baking sheet (round if you prefer) with parchment paper
In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca or arrowroot, 3 Tbsp of the coconut flour, onion and garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and salt. Stir well to fully combine.
In a measuring cup, combine the water, oil, and vinegar , then pour into the dry mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms.
Now stir in the whisked egg to combine well. Once you have a sticky mixture, you will slowly add the remaining coconut flour. I recommend adding a Tbsp at a time and mixing well, allowing the dough to sit a bit after each Tbsp to absorb the liquid, until you have a dough that's still a bit sticky yet able to be spread out. Don't add more than 3 additional Tbsp of coconut flour in this step, even if the dough seems sticky to work with - you can use extra tapioca to help spread it out.
Sprinkle extra tapioca or arrowroot on your parchment lined baking sheet, transfer the dough to the sheet and sprinkle with more tapioca/arrowroot. Work the dough into a 10 inch circle (12 for a very thin crust), then bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes depending on how crisp you want the crust. I baked mine for about 10 minutes before adding my toppings, and baking again. Bake time will depend on the toppings you plan to add, how crispy you want the crust, and how thin you spread it out.
Top your crust however you like! Enjoy!
