** Prep time: 2-4 hours || Cook time: 20 minutes || Serving: two 12" rounds baking sheets || Rating: 10/10 **

#### Ingredients

Note: This list is for regular-crust thickness. For thin-crusts divide the recipe in half and at step 8, bake it for 5 min.

- 2 cup sourdough discard 
- 1 cup warm water
- 5 cups All-Purpose Flour
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast

#### Instructions

1. Stir any liquid on top of your refrigerated starter back into it before measuring 1 cup into a large mixing bowl. Note: This is a good opportunity to feed the remainder of your starter, if necessary.

2. Add the warm water, flour, salt, yeast. Mix to combine, then knead for about 7 minutes in a mixer with the dough hook, until the dough wraps itself around the hook and cleans the side of the bowl.

3. Place the dough in a greased container, cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk. Depending on the vitality of your starter, this will take between 2 and 4 hours. For a faster rise, place the dough in a warm spot, or double the yeast.

4. Divide the dough in half, and shape each into a flattened disk. Drizzle two 12" round pizza pans with olive oil, and brush to coat the bottom. Place the dough in the pans, cover, and let rest for 15 minutes. After this rest, gently press the dough toward the edges of the pans. If it starts to shrink back, cover and let rest for 15 minutes before continuing.

6. Cover the pan(s) and let the dough rise until it's as thick as you like.

7. Towards the end of the rise time, preheat your oven to 450°F.

8. Bake the crust until it become partially cook (about 10 minutes). Then add the sauce and choice of toppings. Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melt (about 5 to 7 min.).

### 3. Authentic Paleo Pizza Crust

** Prep time: 15 minutes || Cook time: 10 minutes || Serving: 1 10" to 12" baking sheets || Rating: X/10 **

#### Ingredients

- 1/3 cup (2 2/3 fluid ounces) warm water
- 3 tablespoons (42 g) extra virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing
- 1 tablespoon (21 g) honey
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (or 1 3/4 teaspoons instant yeast)
- 1 egg at room temperature, beaten
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus a pinch for sprinkling
- 1 1/2 cups (180 g) tapioca flour, and XX cups, plus more for dusting
- 1 cup (120 g) almond flour, plus more as needed

#### Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine the water, olive oil, and honey and whisk to combine well. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit for about 5 minutes, until foamy. 
2. Whisk in the egg. Add the salt and tapioca flour and whisk until a smooth, sticky batter forms. Switch to a spatula or wooden spoon and stir in the almond flour, and then stir in the remaining tapioca flour. The dough should appear shaggy.

    Dust your hands with a little tapioca flour and press the dough into a ball, kneading it a bit to get any floury bits mixed in. If it’s too sticky to come together, add additional almond flour a tablespoons at a time. Return the ball of dough to the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and set it in a warm place for 45 minutes (I usually set my oven to 200°F just for a couple minutes, then turn it off. I then place the bowl of dough in the oven, which is just a little above room temperature). The dough won’t double in size, but will get noticeably bigger. Place a pizza stone or large, overturned rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 375°F.

    Place a large sheet of parchment paper on a flat surface, and, with lightly tapioca floured hands, transfer the ball of dough to the parchment. Pat the dough out into a circle about 12 inches in diameter, pushing out toward the edges to form a puffy rim of crust. Brush the top of the dough with a little bit of olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt.

    Carefully transfer the parchment with the dough onto the pizza stone or sheet pan and bake for 8 minutes. Remove the dough from the oven, prick the middle of the dough in several places with a fork, and add your desired toppings. Return to the oven and for about 5 minutes more. If desired, set the oven to broil and broil the pizza for up to two minutes until browned to your liking. Remove from the oven, slice, and serve hot. Any leftovers will reheat beautifully in just a few minutes in a 400°F oven.
