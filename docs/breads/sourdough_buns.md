** Prep time: 2 hours || Cook time: 22 minutes || Yield: 6 || Rating 10/10 **

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup sourdough starter or discard (unfed)
- 1/2 cup nut milk (slightly warm 100F) or regular milk or 1/2 & half
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon instant yeast (rapid yeast - use fast-acting yeast here, or see notes!)
- 2 cups flour (240 grams) 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
—–
- Eggwash: 1 egg whisked with 1 tablespoon water
- optional seeds: sesame seeds, “everything spice”, etc…

### Instructions

1. Mix warm milk, unfed sourdough starter, oil, and egg in a large bowl (or stand mixer).
2. Mix in salt, sugar,  instant yeast and flour.
3. Combine with fork to form a ball and kneed for 5-6 minutes with a wet hand, (or dough hook).The dough will be sticky – resist the temptation to add more flour (which will result in a heavy bun).  (Alternatively,if mixing by hand, you could do the “stretch and fold ” technique (see 1st video) from the sourdough bread recipe. Do 2-3 sets, 15 minutes apart )
4. Oil the dough in the bowl, cover, place in a warm spot (70-80 F) and let double, 1 – 1 1/2 hours.
5. On a floured surface, gently divide into 6 pieces, form into balls and place on a parchment-lined sheet pan.
6. Let rise again, 30-45 minutes, while you preheat oven to 375F
7. Brush with an Egg Wash, sprinkle with salt and seeds, and bake 20-22  minutes, on the middle rack until perfectly puffed and golden!

** Notes: **

If using regular active dry yeast, mix the yeast with warmed nut milk first until dissolved, let stand 10 minutes before adding starter, oil and egg. Rise time will double.
