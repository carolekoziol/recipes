### General Tao Sauce

Yield: **4 cups**

Cook Time: **5 – 10 minutes** (needs to be watched while cooking)



1. 1 cup ketchup
2. 1/2 cup tamari
3. 1/2 cups water
4. 3/4 cup sugar
5. 3 1/2 Tablespoon mirin
6. 2 Tablespoon sesame oil
7. 1 ½ Tablespoon rice vinegar
8. 1/3 teaspoon black pepper
9. 1 ½ teaspoon sriracha
10. 1 ½ teaspoon ginger, minced
11. 1 ½ teaspoon garlic, minced


### For the slurry:



1. 3 Tbsp. cornstarch
2. 3 Tbsp. water

1.   Combine all of the ingredients in a pot, except for the slurry ingredients. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring continuously. **Do not leave unattended! The sugar can burn easily!**

2.   Mix the slurry ingredients in a bowl. Keeping the heat on medium high, mix the slurry into the sauce in the pot. Keep stirring the sauce over medium high heat until the mixture bubbles and thickens and the slurry is no longer cloudy in the sauce. The finished sauce should be glossy and thick enough to coat a spoon.


### Ginger Lime Tofu

**Yield: **1 Litres

**Prep Time: **30** **minutes


1. 1 block firm tofu, water drained from package (we use locally made and GMO free La Soyarie tofu!)

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well with a whisk.
2. Cut the block of tofu into 10 slices. Place the tofu into the marinade and let rest for at least 1 hour.
3. Lay tofu slices out onto a parchment lined baking sheet and pour a small amount of the marinade over the tofu.
4. Bake at 350 for 20-30 minutes, until most of the marinade has been baked into the tofu and it has darkened slightly.
5. Cut each slice into 2 triangles.
