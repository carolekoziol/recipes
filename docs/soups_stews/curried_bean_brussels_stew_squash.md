- 1 large sweet onion, diced
- 2 to 3 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger
- 2 cups chopped collard greens/kale (or 4 cups baby spinach)
- 3/4 cup rice

- 3 tablespoons melted coconut oil, (divided by 1 tablespoon and 2 tablespoon)
- 3 to 4 bay leaves

### Instructions

1. Cook the Beans: 
	1. Rinse the beans, then put them in a large, heavy-bottomed pot and cover with at least 14 cups of water.  
	2. Add bay leaved, garlic, thyme stalks, and cilantro stems, and bring the liquid to a boil over medium high heat.  
	3. Skim off any foam with a slotted spoon and reduce the heat to a strong simmer.  
	4. Cook for 20 minutes, add a pinch or two of salt, then cook until the beans are tender (time depend on the type of beans being used).  
	5. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid in a large bowl for the base of the stew.  
	6. Discard the bay leaves and the stems.  Set the beans aside, and do not wash the pot.
2. Bake the Squash:
	1. Preheat the oven to 425 F.
	2. In a big bowl, mix in the thyme leave, salt, and pepperte, and 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil.  
	3. Coat the squash in the spice mixture. 
	4. Place the squash on a baking sheet and roast for 20-30 minutes, stirring at halftime, until the squash is tender.
3. Cook the Stew: 
	1. Add 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in the used heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Mix in the ginger and spices for 2 minutes, until fragrant.  
	2. Add the onion and saute for until it is soft and translucent (about 7 minutes).
	3. Add the rice, a large pinch of salt and stir to coat.  
	4. Add 7 cups of the reserved bean cooking liquid and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer, cover the pot, and cook until the rice is almost cooked (about 20 minutes).
	5. Increase the heat to medium high and add the brussels sprouts, cooked beans, and a large pinch of salt.  If using kale, add it at this time as well.  Bring the broth back to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, covered, for another 10 minutes until the brussels sprouts and the rice are tender.
	6. Add the coconut milk, roasted squash, lemon juice, and more salt to taste.  Bring the broth back to a gentle boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for 2 minutes.
	7.  Remove the pot from the heat, Stir in the spinach, if using.
