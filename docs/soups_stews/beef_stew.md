- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 sweet onion, chopped

2. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot. Cook the beef and onions until browned.
3. Add beef broth and red wine while scraping up any brown bits in the pan.
4. Stir in all remaining ingredients except for peas, cornstarch and water. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer 1 hour or until beef is tender (up to 90 minutes).
5. Mix equal parts cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the boiling stew to reach desired consistency (you may not need all of the slurry).

** Notes **

Beef stew meat is often made from the ends of different cuts of beef. If your beef is not tender after 60 minutes, cover and allow to simmer an additional 15-20 minutes or until tender.
