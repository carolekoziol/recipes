** Prep time: 5 minutes || Freeze time: 6-8 hours || Serving: 10-12 popsicles (This is the right yield for the silicone molds) **

### Ingredients

Option 1

- 2 medium bananas, sliced and frozen
- 1 can full-fat coconut milk (13.66 oz.)
- 1 cup frozen fruit (blueberry, mango, or strawberry, etc.)
- 2–3 tablespoons pure maple syrup

Option 2

- 1 can full-fat coconut milk (13.66 oz.)
- 3 cups fresh/frozen fruit

### Instructions

1. Add bananas (if using option 1) and coconut milk to a blender. Blend until smooth. 
2. Add fresh/frozen fruit and maple syrup. Blend until smooth.
