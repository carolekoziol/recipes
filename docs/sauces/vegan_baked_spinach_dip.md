### Ingredients


- 1 tablespoon coconut oil or avocado oil
- 3 cloves garlic, pressed
- 1  package (300g) of frozen spinach, thawed & drained
- 1 cup silken soft tofu

- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon dried dill or 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 F.
2. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat.
3. Add spinach and cook until spinach is heated through about 5-7 minutes.
4. Add garlic and cook until fragrant 30 seconds.
5. In a blender: add tofu, rinsed cashews, tapioca starch, apple cider vinegar, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder and salt and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust salt to your liking.
6. Transfer the tofu cream mixture and the spinach to a mixing bowl along with dill, pepper and Worcestershire sauce, and mix.
7. Transfer to an oven safe dish (casserole dish, cast iron pan, or baking dish).
8. Bake until the dip is bubbly, and the top is golden brown; about 25 - 30 minutes.
    
Serve hot with dippers of your choosing; like toasted baguette, pita, chips, or fresh cut veggies.
