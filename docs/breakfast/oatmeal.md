- fruits (apples, pears, berries, bananas, kiwi, oranges etc.)
- sweeteners (honey or maple syrup) 

** Instructions **

1. In a large saucepan, bring the milk (and any dry fruit, if using) to a gentle simmer over medium heat.

- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- pinch of sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon chopped walnuts or peanuts for topping

** Instructions **

1. Add oats, banana slices, milk, cinnamon and salt to a pot and stir to combine. Heat over medium-high heat until the oatmeal is to your desired consistency (about 8-10 minutes). 
	- Be sure to stir the oats several times while cooking to make sure the banana slices melt into the oats. 
2. Portion oats into two bowls and serve with peanut butter, and banana slices. Add a splash of milk and/or maple syrup on top before serving, if desired.

### 3. Peanut Butter and Jam

** Ingredients **

- 2-3 tablespoons peanut butter, plus more for topping

2. Add peanut butter, jam and vanilla until combined.
3. Divide into bowls and serve with more milk and top with a drizzle of peanut butter, jam, freeze-dried berries and chopped peanuts before serving, if desired.

### 4. Apple Cinnamon 

** Ingredients **

- 1/2 cup chopped apples

    After the oats finish cooking, allow the pressure to release naturally (about 10-15 minutes).
    After the pressure releases, open the lid and give the oatmeal a good stir. Any extra liquid will absorb as it cools. Stir in the maple syrup.
