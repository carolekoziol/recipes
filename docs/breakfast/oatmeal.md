** Prep time: 10 minutes || Cook time: 10 minutes || Serving: 2 || Rating 10/10 **

** Ingredients **

- 1 cup rolled oats (steel cut oats will need to be cooked longer)
- 2 cups milk (nut, soy, oat, etc.) or water
- dash salt
- optional additions of your choice:
	- dried fruits (apricots, raisins, cranberries, etc.)
	- fruits (apples, pears, berries, bananas, kiwi, oranges etc.)
	- nuts (almond slices, walnuts, shredded coconut, peanuts etc.)
	- sweeteners (honey or maple syrup) 
	- dash cinnamon 
	
** Instructions **

1. In a large saucepan, bring the milk (and any dry fruit, if using) to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
1. Add the oats, mix, and allow the mixture to come to a boil (be careful, as this will boil over very easily).
1. Reduce heat to low, and allow to simmer, with frequent mixing, for about 5 minutes, or until the oatmeal reaches the desired consistency.
1. Serve with chopped fresh fruit.
