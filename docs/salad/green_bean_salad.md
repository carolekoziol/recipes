** Prep time: 30 minutes || Cook time: 35 minutes || Serving: 10 || Rating 9/10 **

### Ingredients

- 4 medium size beets, boiled and peeled
	- (or roasted sweet potatoes or butternut squash)
- 2 pounds fresh green beans trimmed and cut in half
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 cup minced sweet onions
- 1/2 cup craisins or sweet raisins
- 1 1/2 cups mozzarella, grated
- 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts 
	- (crushed walnuts, slice of almonds, sweet apples/peaches)
- cooked chickpeas, optional

** DRESSING **

- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
- 1/2 teaspoon each for salt, pepper, garlic powder, to taste

### Instructions

** 1. BEETS: **

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 
2. Cut the beets into 1- 1 Â½ inch chunks.
3. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and some salt and pepper. 
4. Place beets on a baking sheet and roast for 35-40 minutes or until the beets are fork tender.

** 2. GREEN BEANS: **

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and stir in two tablespoon salt. Add the green beans and cook until tender crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. 
2. Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of ice water to transfer the greens to. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beans to ice water to stop cooking. 
3. Drain the beans and pat very dry. 
4. When completely dry, transfer to a large salad bowl.

** 3. DRESSING: **

1. Add all of the dressing ingredients and whisk together in a small bowl. 
2. Refrigerate dressing until ready to use. If serving salad within the hour, then place dressing in the freezer to quickly chill.

** 4. COMBINE THE SALAD: **

1. Combine green beans with tomatoes, beets, onion, and craisins. Drizzle with some of the dressing, cover and chill one hour (time permitting). When ready to serve, mozzarella, nuts and additional dressing if desired. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

** NOTES: **

Plan ahead when making the Green Bean Salad so it has time to chill for at least 1 hour, best if 2.  This allows for the beans to marinate in the dressing.
