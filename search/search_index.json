The gases need to escape. If you are refrigerating the starter, seal the container. Flavour and texture are affected by ingredients, fermentation time, and temperature. Food ferments faster in warm weather, slower in cool weather. For faster fermentation times pit it in a warmer area. Better flavour often results from longer fermentation time at a cooler temperature. Make sure your jar, utensils, etc. are clean but you do not have to sterilize like canning. Avoid metal and plastic. ONLY USE TALL GLASS or CERAMIC CONTAINERS like a mason wide mouth jar for actual fermentation period. Put the starter where you are able to monitor them and wont forget about them. Feeding If starter has been refrigerated, remove it and let it warm to room temperature. Discard all but a tablespoon of the starter (pro-tip: save the discard in a mason jar in the fridge, and use it in other recipes!). Feed your starter in a ratio of about 3:2, flour to water. You want the starter to have a paste-like consistency - like Elmer's glue. Start with white flour You can convert your starter over to whole-wheat or rye gradually by adding a bit at a time, Your flour must contain gluten for it to work. Stir (use a chop stick) vigorously to introduce oxygen into it. This is an important step! Cover with something that lets it breathe (a paper towel held down with an elastic band works well), and let it sit on the counter for a few hours. Discard all but a tablespoon, and feed your starter regularly (a few tablespoons of flour and water) over the next couple of days at least every 12 hours. It is better to feed it gradually than a whole bunch at once. If you see a greyish layer of water at the top or your starter smells a bit like nail polish remover, it means that you need to feed it more often. Your starter is ready for baking when it is a nice and bubbly and has a bread-like, yeasty smell to it. The temperature and humidity can really affect how quickly your starter gets bubbly. The more bubbly your starter is, the more quickly your bread will rise. Use your starter or refrigerate! Make sure you have enough to build up for your next batch of bread. Common problems and what to do What if I forget to feed it? When sourdough starter is neglected \u2014 left on the counter or in the refrigerator for extended periods without being fed \u2014 the yeast and bacteria run out of food, and their populations gradually decline. Basically, your starter is dying a slow death; the longer it's left unfed, the more difficult it will be to revive it and get it ready for baking. Feeding your starter regularly can prevent this situation. And also cure it: If you do happen to forget your starter for a while, a series of regular feedings should restore its health. What's the \"right\" aroma? Sourdough starter should smell sharply sour but \"clean,\" with no overtones of spoilage, or any oddly chemical smell (think acetone). While the aroma of sourdough may make you draw back simply from its strength, it shouldn't be distasteful. When to throw it out? When your starter is neglected for an extended period, the liquid on top tends to turn from clear to dirty looking dark-colored water. This is called the \"hooch\". This is normal; simply stir the liquid back into the starter and feed it the meal it's desperately craving. However, if your starter shows visible signs of mould, or an orange or pink tint/streak, or smells \u2014 well, putrid \u2014 throw it out; it's been invaded by harmful microorganisms, and it's time to start over.

When fully kneaded, place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 hour. Fold: Give the dough a fold: Turn it out onto a floured surface and, using a bowl scraper or bench knife, fold it like a business letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees. Gently flatten it a bit, and repeat the letter fold. Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and let it rise for another hour. Pre-Shape: At the end of the rise, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Gently shape into two rounds, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes. Shape: Form into a loaf shape of your choosing. Leave to rise in a dutch oven for 3 hours (or overnight) until risen (cover the second loaf with a towel, and leave on the counter). Preheat the oven to 400F. score the loaf (for example, one line in the middle of your loaf) about an inch deep. Put the lid of your dutch oven on (make sure it is put on correctly so the steam does its work). Bake for 25 minutes, and remove the lid. Bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, until crust is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool completely before slicing. 2. Beer Sourdough Bread (for 2 small loaves) Ingredients 12 oz. room temperature beer (The type of beer will affect the flavour of the bread.) 1 cup active sourdough starter (recently fed so it is bubbly) 4 Tablespoon of sugar (honey, cane sugar, or etc.) 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 5 cups white bread flour or all- purpose flour Instructions Mix beer and sourdough starter in a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients and mix to form soft dough. Leave it a little on the wet side, you can add more water, which makes bread with more holes. If dough is sticky keep your hands wet. First Rise: Leave it in the bowl in a warmish room-temperature place to rise for 1 hour. Knead: After the first rise, gently knead dough (punch it down) for a couple of minutes, until it's smooth and supple, though still somewhat soft and tacky.

Allow the dough to rest for about 20 minutes. Add salt and knead dough for about 5 minutes. If dough is too sticky, add more flour but dough should be soft and not dry and stiff. First Rise: Leave it in the oiled bowl in a warmish room-temperature place to rise for 1 hour. Knead: After the first rise, gently knead dough (punch it down) for a couple of minutes, until it's smooth and supple, though still somewhat soft and tacky.

Bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, until crust is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool completely before slicing. Notes Pre-shaping dough creates the basic shape the loaf will eventually be, without refining that shape. Why pre-shape? Any time you handle dough its gluten tightens up, making it more resistant to further shaping. Pre-shaping dough then letting it rest before its final shaping relaxes its gluten, making it much easier to shape into its final form. Loaf should feel light for its size, and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. To freeze: Slice your loaf and put it in a brown bag and put the brown bag in a plastic freezer Ziploc bag.","title":"Sourdough Bread"},{"location":"breads/sourdough_bread/#sourdough-loaves","text":"[Original Recipe From Radical Health and King Arthur Flour] Serving: 2 loaves || Rating 10/10","title":"Sourdough Loaves"},{"location":"breads/sourdough_bread/#1-plain-sourdough-bread-for-2-loaves","text":"","title":"1.

Original Recipe by Lauren Toyota Prep time: 25 minutes || Cook time: 50 minutes || Serving: 6 || Rating 10/10 Ingredients Cauliflower Burgers: 1 head of cauliflower (3 thick slices, 6 halves) 1/2 cup nondairy milk 1/2 cup water 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (or rice flour if gluten free) 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground paprika 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon vegan butter 1/2 cup Frank's RedHot sauce (very spicy) Less spicy: 1/4 cup Frank's RedHot sauce Mild: Ranch sauce: 1 cup vegan mayonnaise 2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill 2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoon finely chopped chives 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder salt and black pepper, to taste Topping for your burgers: burger buns (can be slightly toasted) onions, slices lettuce tomatoes, slices Ranch sauce, to spread on each side of the bun Cauliflower burger Instructions Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Trim off any green leaves at the base of the cauliflower, but leave most of the stem in tact. Cut the head of cauliflower in half and then cut 2-inch x 1/2-inch steaks from each of the inside sides. You can use the remaining cauliflower to make buffalo wings or just use it in another recipe like my mushroom sage cauliflower risotto. Roasting it in the oven with sea salt, ground black pepper, and olive oil is delicious, too! Mix the flour, nondairy milk, water, spices, sea salt, and ground black pepper in a mixing bowl with a whisk until well combined. Transfer this mixture to a wide shallow baking dish that will fit your cauliflower steaks. Dredge the steaks through the batter and use your hands to coat them quite well, getting in all the crevices. Place the battered cauliflower steaks onto the parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the ranch sauce and buffalo sauce. In a bowl, whisk all the ingredients together for the ranch. Refrigerate until you're ready to assemble the sandwiches. Just before the cauliflower is finished baking, melt the vegan butter and whisk it into the hot sauce in a shallow dish you can dredge the cauliflower steaks in once again.

Trim off any green leaves at the base of the cauliflower, but leave most of the stem in tact. Cut the head of cauliflower in half and then cut 2-inch x 1/2-inch steaks from each of the inside sides. You can use the remaining cauliflower to make buffalo wings or just use it in another recipe like my mushroom sage cauliflower risotto. Roasting it in the oven with sea salt, ground black pepper, and olive oil is delicious, too! Mix the flour, nondairy milk, water, spices, sea salt, and ground black pepper in a mixing bowl with a whisk until well combined. Transfer this mixture to a wide shallow baking dish that will fit your cauliflower steaks. Dredge the steaks through the batter and use your hands to coat them quite well, getting in all the crevices. Place the battered cauliflower steaks onto the parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the ranch sauce and buffalo sauce. In a bowl, whisk all the ingredients together for the ranch. Refrigerate until you're ready to assemble the sandwiches. Just before the cauliflower is finished baking, melt the vegan butter and whisk it into the hot sauce in a shallow dish you can dredge the cauliflower steaks in once again.

Lightly grease a round 10 or 9-inch pie dish. Wrap rinsed tofu in a few tea towels. Place a few books on top of it to lightly press out the water. Set it aside. For the crust: In a small bowl, whisk together flax and water mixture. Set aside so it can gel up. In a large bowl, stir together: the almond meal, oat flour (or buckwheat flour), parsley, oregano and salt. Add in the flax mixture and oil. Stir until mostly combined, adding the remaining water until the dough is sticky (about the consistency of cookie dough). The dough should stick together when you press it between your fingers. Crumble the dough evenly over the base of the pie dish. Starting from the centre of the pan, press the mixture evenly into the pan, working your way outward and up the sides of the pan. Poke a few fork holes in the dough so air can escape. Bake the crust at 350F for 13-16 minutes, or until lightly golden and firm to touch. Set aside to cool. For the filling: Break apart the tofu block into 4 pieces and add into food processor. Process the tofu until smooth and creamy. If it doesn't get creamy, add a tiny splash of almond milk. In a skillet, add oil and saute the leek (or onion) and garlic over medium heat for a few minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, season with salt, and cook on medium-high heat until most of the water cooks off the mushrooms, about 10-12 minutes. Stir in the herbs, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, nutritional yeast, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the spinach is wilted. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the processed tofu until thoroughly combined. Adjust seasoning to taste if desired. Add the filling into baked crust and smooth out until even. Bake quiche, uncovered, at 375F for 33-37 minutes, until the quiche is firm to the touch. Cool the quiche for 10 minutes on a cooling rack before slicing. The crust may crumble slightly when sliced warm. Serve it hot or cold. Notes You can make it with different vegetables. However don't use a high-water vegetable (e.g. tomatoes) as it might result in a water-logged quiche.

For the crust: In a small bowl, whisk together flax and water mixture. Set aside so it can gel up. In a large bowl, stir together: the almond meal, oat flour (or buckwheat flour), parsley, oregano and salt. Add in the flax mixture and oil. Stir until mostly combined, adding the remaining water until the dough is sticky (about the consistency of cookie dough). The dough should stick together when you press it between your fingers. Crumble the dough evenly over the base of the pie dish. Starting from the centre of the pan, press the mixture evenly into the pan, working your way outward and up the sides of the pan. Poke a few fork holes in the dough so air can escape. Bake the crust at 350F for 13-16 minutes, or until lightly golden and firm to touch. Set aside to cool. For the filling: Break apart the tofu block into 4 pieces and add into food processor. Process the tofu until smooth and creamy. If it doesn't get creamy, add a tiny splash of almond milk. In a skillet, add oil and saute the leek (or onion) and garlic over medium heat for a few minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, season with salt, and cook on medium-high heat until most of the water cooks off the mushrooms, about 10-12 minutes. Stir in the herbs, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, nutritional yeast, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the spinach is wilted. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the processed tofu until thoroughly combined. Adjust seasoning to taste if desired. Add the filling into baked crust and smooth out until even. Bake quiche, uncovered, at 375F for 33-37 minutes, until the quiche is firm to the touch. Cool the quiche for 10 minutes on a cooling rack before slicing. The crust may crumble slightly when sliced warm. Serve it hot or cold.","title":"Instructions"},{"location":"main_course/tofu_quiche/#notes","text":"You can make it with different vegetables.

Pour 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the large container and give it a few stir. Allow beans to soak overnight for at least 8 - 16 hours. If your house is very warm, place the large container in the fridge to avoid fermentation. Quick Soaking Method: If you're short on time or forgot to soak the beans overnight, you can use this quick soaking method instead. The result will not be as good as the overnight soaking method. Place 1 pound (454g) dried navy beans, 1.5 tbsp (25g) fine table salt, and 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the pressure cooker. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 0 minute + 30 minutes Natural Release. Drain Beans: Discard the soaked water and drain the navy beans through a mesh strainer. Rinse the beans with cold tap water. Drain well. The soaked beans should almost double in weight. Render Bacon: Place chopped bacon in Pressure Cooker and turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press Saut\u00e9 button). Stir occasionally and allow the bacon bits to crisp (~3 mins). Add in diced onion, freshly ground black pepper and saut\u00e9 for a minute. Add in chopped garlic cloves and saut\u00e9 until fragrant (~30 seconds). Create Molasses Mixture: While the bacon is rendering in pressure cooker, combine \u00bc cup (80g) blackstrap molasses, \u00bc cup (60g) maple syrup, 1 tbsp (15ml) light soy sauce, and 1 \u00be cup (438) cold water in a 1L (4 cups) glass measuring cup. Mix well. Deglaze: Pour \u00bd cup (125ml) of the molasses mixture in the Instant Pot. Deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pan and mix them into the mixture. Pressure Cook Navy Beans: Add \u00bc tsp fine table salt, 2 bay leaves, soaked navy beans (889g) and the remaining molasses mixture in the pressure cooker. Mix well and make sure all the beans are submerged in the molasses mixture. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 20 minutes + 20 minutes Natural Release. Important Tip: The pressure cooking time may vary depending on many factors such as the age of beans. If your beans are not fully cooked, simply add pressure cooking time accordingly. For reference, some readers reported their beans need to pressure cook for an extra 15 - 25 mins. After 20 minutes, turn the venting knob to venting position to release the remaining pressure. Open the lid carefully. Season and Thicken Baked Beans: Add 2 tsp (12g) dijon mustard, and 1 tsp (5ml) apple cider vinegar into the cooked baked beans. Mix well. Turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press Saut\u00e9 button) and stir to thicken the baked beans to desired consistency.

About 3/4 of an inch in from the root, drive a wooden skewer through the center of the onion. Push the skewer all the way through, so that the flat end of the skewer is next to the onion and the pointy end is as far away from the onion as possible. On one side of the skewer, slice the root end off of the onion. On the other side of the skewer, leaving about 3/4 inch of onion, slice the onion so that the skewer is going through the center of the slice. Use a knife to cut the part of the skewer that is sticking out of the onion. Repeat until both onions have been sliced into even slices, about 3/4 inch thick. Trim the skewers so that there is not excess sticking out of the onion. Brush the slices on both sides with olive oil, season with salt and pepper. - On a charcoal grill: Make a two zone fire - coals on one side and no coals on the other. Place the onions on the cool side of the grill and flip and roate every 10 to 15 minutes until they are golden brown. Onions are done when golden and tender (in about 25-40 minutes) - On a gas grill: Heat the grill for 5-10 minutes. Lower the burners to low and cook the onions on the low burner, flipping every 10 minutes. Onions are done when golden and tender (about 25-40 minutes). Notes: Use sweet onions such as Walla Walla or Vidalia. The sugars in the onion caramelize perfectly. Use wooden skewers. They can be cut to fit the onion, so each onion is skewerd individually. Running the skewer through the center of the onion will keep the tender, middle part of the onion (the best part!) from falling out through the grates. Cook low and slow. If you use high heat the outside of the onion will burn while the inside will be underdone. Slice onions into even slices to ensure even cooking.","title":"Grilled Onions (Ve, P, GF)"},{"location":"sides/grilled_onions/#grilled-onions","text":"Original Recipe from Fox and Briar Total time: 40 minutes || Serving: 4","title":"Grilled Onions"},{"location":"sides/grilled_onions/#ingredients","text":"2 sweet onions, such as Walla Walla or Vidalia 1 tablespoon olive oil kosher salt fresh ground pepper","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"sides/grilled_onions/#instructions","text":"Hold the onion on a cutting board, with the root end facing sideways.

Home-made Potsticker wrappers Original Recipe from The Flavor Bender 285g of all purpose Flour 150-175 ml of boiled water (see note 1 & 2) 1 tsp salt Instructions In a bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Create a well in the middle (like you would when making pasta) Add hot water slowly, while mixing with a wooden spoon until flour forms clumpy bits. You can alternate mixing and pouring water. Knead the dough clumps by hand to form one soft dough ball. If the mix is too dry, add a little more of the water at a time. If the mix is too sticky, add a little flour at a time. Knead the dough further on the work bench for about 2 minutes. Use flour sparingly if the dough is getting sticky. The dough will look smooth at this stage and be a little stretchy/elastic. You can let the dough rest like this in one big ball, or cut it roughly into four equal parts and knead each piece to form a dough ball. Wrap the dough/dough balls tightly in plastic wrap (individually) or place it inside a zip-lock bag and seal it (push out as much air as possible) and let it rest for at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. You can use the dough immediately after it has been rested. If you are using it the next day instead, place the dough in the fridge (sealed in bags) and return it back to room temperature before handling them. Lightly dust your work bench and rolling pin with flour. Roll out each piece of the dough (dusting lightly with flour as needed) as thin as you can. Once the dough has been rolled out, (make sure the dough is not sticking to the counter top), cut out the dumpling wrappers using a round biscuit cutter of 3.5-4 inches in diameter. Re-knead the leftover dough and re-roll it once more (after resting it for 30 minutes at least) to cut out more dumpling wrappers. Use them immediately with your choice of filling. Notes The amount of water changes depending on the brand of the flour and the temperature. Keep an eye out for the right consistency. The common amount of flour to water ratio is roughly 2:1 Boil the water first, and then measure the required amount of water. Do not measure water first and then boil it, as evaporation = less water! If you are stacking the wrappers after cutting them out, they will require flour between each one to prevent sticking.","title":"Mushroom spinach potstickers (Ve, P, GF)"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#mushroom-spinach-potstickers","text":"Original Recipe by Pure Mamas Prep time: 15 minutes || Cook time: 10 minutes || Total time: 25 || Yield: 12","title":"Mushroom Spinach Potstickers"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#ingredients","text":"3.5 oz mushrooms finely chopped (about 2 cups) 1-2 red/orange bell peppers, finely chopped 3 small cloves garlic or 1 large one, pressed or chopped 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil or butter (separate) 1 Tbsp shallots, finely chopped 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped pinch sea salt 1 package of potsticker or gyoza wrappers (or home-made potsticker wrappers recipe below) glass of water to dip your fingers in dipping sauce (recipe below)","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#instructions","text":"In a large frying pan add 1 Tbsp oil (save the other Tbsp for later), mushrooms, bell peppers, garlic and sea salt.

The gases need to escape. If you are regrigerating the starter, seal the container. Flavour and texture are affected by ingredients, fermentation time, and temperature. Food ferments faster in warm weather, slower in cool wather. For faster fermentation times pit it in a warmer area. Better flavour often results from longer fermentation time at a cooler temperature. Make sure your jar, utensils, stc are clean but you do not have to sterilize like canning. Avoid metal and plastic. ONLY USE TALL GLASS or CERAMIC CONTAINERS like a mason wide-mouth jar for actual fermentation period. Put the starter where you are able to monitor them and wont forget about them. Feeding If starter has been refrigerated, remove it and let it warm to room temperature. Feed your starter in a ratio of about 3:2, flour to water. You want the starter to have a paste like consistency - like Elmer's glue. Start with white flour You can convert your starter over to whole-wheat or rye gradually by adding a bit at a time, Your flour must contain gluten for it to work. Stir (use a chop stick) vigorously to introduce oxygen into it. This is an important step! Cover with something that lets it breath and let it sit on the counter for a few hours. Feed your starter regularly (a fews tablespoons of flour and water) over the next couple of days at least every 12 hours. It is better to feed it gradually than a whole bunch at once. If you see a greyish layer of water at the top or your starter smells a bit like nail polish remover, it means that you need to feed it more often. Your starter is ready for baking when it is a nice and bubbly and has a bread-like, yeasty smell to it. The temperature and humidity can really affect how quickly your starter gets bubbly. The more bubbly your starter is, the more quickly your bread will rise. Use your starter or refrigerate! Make sure you have enough to build up for your nect bactch of bread. Common problems and what to do What if I forget to feed it? When sourdough starter is neglected \u2014 left on the counter or in the refrigerator for extended periods without being fed \u2014 the yeast and bacteria run out of food, and their populations gradually decline. Basically, your starter is dying a slow death; the longer it's left unfed, the more difficult it will be to revive it and get it ready for baking. Feeding your starter regularly can prevent this situation. And also cure it: If you do happen to forget your starter for a while, a series of regular feedings should restore its health. What's the \"right\" aroma? Sourdough starter should smell sharply sour but \"clean,\" with no overtones of spoilage, or any oddly chemical smell (think acetone). While the aroma of sourdough may make you draw back simply from its strength, it shouldn't be distasteful. When to throw it out? When your starter is neglected for an extended period, the liquid on top tends to turn from clear to dirty looking dark-colored water. This is called the \"hooch\". This is normal; simply stir the liquid back into the starter and feed it the meal it's desperately craving. However, if your starter shows visible signs of mold, or an orange or pink tint/streak, or smells \u2014 well, putrid \u2014 throw it out; it's been invaded by harmful microorganisms, and it's time to start over.
