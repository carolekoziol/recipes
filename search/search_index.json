The gases need to escape. If you are refrigerating the starter, seal the container. Flavour and texture are affected by ingredients, fermentation time, and temperature. Food ferments faster in warm weather, slower in cool weather. For faster fermentation times pit it in a warmer area. Better flavour often results from longer fermentation time at a cooler temperature. Make sure your jar, utensils, etc. are clean but you do not have to sterilize like canning. Avoid metal and plastic. ONLY USE TALL GLASS or CERAMIC CONTAINERS like a mason wide mouth jar for actual fermentation period. Put the starter where you are able to monitor them and wont forget about them. Feeding If starter has been refrigerated, remove it and let it warm to room temperature. Discard all but a tablespoon of the starter (pro-tip: save the discard in a mason jar in the fridge, and use it in other recipes!). Feed your starter in a ratio of about 3:2, flour to water. You want the starter to have a paste-like consistency - like Elmer's glue. Start with white flour You can convert your starter over to whole-wheat or rye gradually by adding a bit at a time, Your flour must contain gluten for it to work. Stir (use a chop stick) vigorously to introduce oxygen into it. This is an important step! Cover with something that lets it breathe (a paper towel held down with an elastic band works well), and let it sit on the counter for a few hours. Discard all but a tablespoon, and feed your starter regularly (a few tablespoons of flour and water) over the next couple of days at least every 12 hours. It is better to feed it gradually than a whole bunch at once. If you see a greyish layer of water at the top or your starter smells a bit like nail polish remover, it means that you need to feed it more often. Your starter is ready for baking when it is a nice and bubbly and has a bread-like, yeasty smell to it. The temperature and humidity can really affect how quickly your starter gets bubbly. The more bubbly your starter is, the more quickly your bread will rise. Use your starter or refrigerate! Make sure you have enough to build up for your next batch of bread. Common problems and what to do What if I forget to feed it? When sourdough starter is neglected \u2014 left on the counter or in the refrigerator for extended periods without being fed \u2014 the yeast and bacteria run out of food, and their populations gradually decline. Basically, your starter is dying a slow death; the longer it's left unfed, the more difficult it will be to revive it and get it ready for baking. Feeding your starter regularly can prevent this situation. And also cure it: If you do happen to forget your starter for a while, a series of regular feedings should restore its health. What's the \"right\" aroma? Sourdough starter should smell sharply sour but \"clean,\" with no overtones of spoilage, or any oddly chemical smell (think acetone). While the aroma of sourdough may make you draw back simply from its strength, it shouldn't be distasteful. When to throw it out? When your starter is neglected for an extended period, the liquid on top tends to turn from clear to dirty looking dark-colored water. This is called the \"hooch\". This is normal; simply stir the liquid back into the starter and feed it the meal it's desperately craving. However, if your starter shows visible signs of mould, or an orange or pink tint/streak, or smells \u2014 well, putrid \u2014 throw it out; it's been invaded by harmful microorganisms, and it's time to start over.

Rustic Italian Pizza Dough Original Recipe by Florentina Prep time: 10 minutes || Cook time: 7 minutes || Total time: 17 minutes || Serving: 6 || Rating X/10 Ingredients 5 cups all purpose or 00 flour + some for dusting 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt 2 1/4 cups COLD water 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil Instructions on Preparing the Dough Stand Mixer Method In the bowl of your stand mixer and using the paddle attachment: mix in the flour, sea salt and active dry yeast on low speed until all is incorporated. Then add the COLD water. Switch to the dough hook and mix together on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom. If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry then add a bit more water. After the 8 minutes have passed remove the dough from the stand mixer and cut it into 6 pieces and form them into rounds ball. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tbs of extra virgin olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature and rise for 2 hours in a draft free area. Place a pizza stone in the oven (place the rack near the top of the oven, as the broiler will be used to finish the pizza), and preheat as high as it will go for at least 45 minutes to one hour. Sprinkle the counter with a little bit of flour, take one piece of dough and press down on it with your fingers until you have 1/2\" thick circle or oval. Using your fists and knuckles start stretching the dough until 10\" in diameter making sure not to tear it ( this should be easy since it is a small pie). Add your topping and bake in the oven at 400F. Hand Kneading Method Pour the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast, salt and cold water and using a wooden spoon mix to combine well. Sprinkle some flour on a work surface, after placing the pizza dough, sprinkle some more flour on top.

Leave it a little on the wet side, you can add more water, which makes bread with more holes. If dough is sticky keep your hands wet. First Rise: Leave it in the bowl in a warmish room-temperature place to rise for 1 hour. Knead: After the first rise, gently knead dough (punch it down) for a couple of minutes, until it's smooth and supple, though still somewhat soft and tacky. When fully kneaded, place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 hour. Fold: Give the dough a fold: Turn it out onto a floured surface and, using a bowl scraper or bench knife, fold it like a business letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees. Gently flatten it a bit, and repeat the letter fold. Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and let it rise for another hour. Pre-Shape: At the end of the rise, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Gently shape into two rounds, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes. Shape: Form into a loaf shape of your choosing. Leave to rise in a dutch oven for 3 hours (or overnight) until risen (cover the second loaf with a towel, and leave on the counter).

Notes Pre-shaping dough creates the basic shape the loaf will eventually be, without refining that shape. Why pre-shape? Any time you handle dough its gluten tightens up, making it more resistant to further shaping. Pre-shaping dough then letting it rest before its final shaping relaxes its gluten, making it much easier to shape into its final form. Loaf should feel light for its size, and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. To freeze: Slice your loaf and put it in a brown bag and put the brown bag in a plastic freezer Ziploc bag.","title":"Sourdough Bread"},{"location":"breads/sourdough_bread/#sourdough-loaves","text":"[Original Recipe From Radical Health and King Arthur Flour] Serving: 2 loaves || Rating 10/10","title":"Sourdough Loaves"},{"location":"breads/sourdough_bread/#1-plain-sourdough-bread-for-2-loaves","text":"","title":"1.

FILLING: In a large pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil until hot. Add the ground beef and cook for 3 minutes. Add onion and cook until beef is brown and onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, green thai chili, salt, pepper to the meat. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the peas and cilantro, then cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the meat filling from the heat and let cool. 2. WRAPPER: In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, olive oil, and water. Use your hand or a spatula to mix together. Once the dough pulls away from sides of the bowl, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 4 minutes or until the dough is smooth and soft. Shape dough into a ball and brush with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and a warm damp tea towel. Let rest for 30 minutes. Remove tea towel and plastic wrap and roll the dough out into a 10-inch (25-cm) long log. Cut into 10 even sections. Take one section and roll it into a ball. Place the ball on a lightly floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a thin circle about 10 inches (25-cm) in diameter. Repeat with the remaining dough. Stack the dough circles as you roll them out, sprinkling a bit of flour between each one and keeping them covered with plastic wrap so they don't dry out. 3. COMBINE AND COOK THE SAMOSAS: In a greased large pan over high heat, place one of the circles of dough and cook for 10 seconds on each side. Repeat with remaining dough. Cut one of the par-cooked dough circles into four quarters. Take one quarter and, with the round side closest to you, fold the bottom half to the right. Use the flour paste to seal the fold. Repeat with the left side, crossing over your previous fold to create a cone like pocket. Fill the pocket with meat filling, then fold the remaining tip of the dough towards you and seal with flour paste. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. In a large, deep pan, heat the canola oil to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Once the oil is at the correct temperature, carefully place 4-6 sambusas in the pan.

Use just enough oil so that the Schnitzels \"swim\" in it. Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown.

To roll, lift up the bottom part of the bamboo sushi mat and roll the rice covered nori over the fillings you\u2019ve just placed on the rice.

Crumble the dough evenly over the base of the pie dish. Starting from the centre of the pan, press the mixture evenly into the pan, working your way outward and up the sides of the pan.

Transfer the tofu to a medium-sized bowl. Transfer 3 tablespoons of the sauce you just made. Carefully fold together with a spatula, so the tofu is evenly coated with sauce. Marinate for 10 minutes, or until ready to use. Heat a pot of water to bring to a boil. Remove from heat and soak the rice noodles according to the package instructions. It usually takes 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the product. The noodles should become al-dente, soft enough to eat but not too tender. Chop and prep all the veggies and herbs. (Optional) Mix all the ingredients for the vegan egg in a medium-sized bowl. Stir until no lumps remain. To cook the eggs, heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in a small nonstick pan (*Footnote 3) over medium heat until hot. Add the egg mixture. Let cook without touching for 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom sets completely and the top is still a bit runny. Stir with a spatula to break apart the mixture. Let cook, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring and breaking apart occasionally, until the mixture is cooked through and the surface turns light golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Add 1/2 tablespoon oil to the same nonstick pan. Add the tofu along with the marinade. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce evaporates and the surface of the tofu turns golden brown. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok (or nonstick pan, or carbon steel pan) and heat over medium high heat until hot. Add the carrot, shallots, and garlic. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Add the noodles and pour in the sauce. Toss with a pair of tongs to mix well, 1 minute or so. Add tofu, green onions, and bean sprouts. Toss one more time. Add the peanuts and the cooked chickpea eggs. Give it a final stir and remove the pan from the heat immediately. Transfer everything onto serving plates. Serve hot as a main dish. Notes You can also use homemade oyster sauce. You can use 2 large eggs to replace this step if you\u2019re cooking a vegetarian (not vegan) dish. I used a small nonstick pan and a big carbon steel pan to cook the recipe.

Trim off any green leaves at the base of the cauliflower, but leave most of the stem in tact. Cut the head of cauliflower in half and then cut 2-inch x 1/2-inch steaks from each of the inside sides. You can use the remaining cauliflower to make buffalo wings or just use it in another recipe like my mushroom sage cauliflower risotto.

Mix the flour, nondairy milk, water, spices, sea salt, and ground black pepper in a mixing bowl with a whisk until well combined. Transfer this mixture to a wide shallow baking dish that will fit your cauliflower steaks. Dredge the steaks through the batter and use your hands to coat them quite well, getting in all the crevices. Place the battered cauliflower steaks onto the parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the ranch sauce and buffalo sauce. In a bowl, whisk all the ingredients together for the ranch. Refrigerate until you're ready to assemble the sandwiches. Just before the cauliflower is finished baking, melt the vegan butter and whisk it into the hot sauce in a shallow dish you can dredge the cauliflower steaks in once again. Remove the cauliflower from the oven. You may want to let them cool so you can handle them. You might need to replace your parchment paper if it's really soaked through or burned quite a bit.

If you use inferior quality, you will not have the same outcome, or the same flavor as the authentic italian sauce. Instructions Pour the oil into a large saute pan (not a deep pot) over medium high heat. Crush the garlic and add it to the oil (if you want a spicy sauce, you can add some hot pepper, fresh or flakes, at this point). Saute the garlic until it just starts to brown, then add the parsley. Turn the heat up to high. Now add the tomatoes, and quickly cover with the lid for about 30 seconds, until the squirting subsides. Stir with a wooden spoon and lower the heat a little. It is important that this sauce is cooked at a fast simmer, as it is cooked briefly. Add the salt and continue to simmer at a fast pace, and stir often. The sauce will thicken quickly, so do not overcook it, and have it become too thick; about 5 to 7 minutes should be sufficient. Taste the sauce, if it doesn't taste delicious, it probably just needs a little more salt. Turn off the heat and add the fresh basil (I tear mine into pieces). Also, unless absolutely necessary, do not wash your basil. Wipe it with a damp paper towel instead, so the water doesn't ruin the flavor and aroma. Add sauce to the drained pasta (save some pasta water to add back into the pasta in case it's too dry), and enjoy immediately with some freshly grated authentic Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and/or pepper. Also, if you've been plating pasta in a bowl, then topping it with sauce, this is American-style. If you want to serve it the way they do in Italy, mix the sauce in and then plate it.","title":"Authentic Italian Tomato Sauce (P, Ve, GF)"},{"location":"sauces/italian_tomato_sauce/#authentic-quick-italian-tomato-sauce-for-pasta","text":"Original Recipe by Christianne Cote Prep time: XX minutes || Cook time: XX minutes || Serving: 6 || Rating X/10","title":"Authentic (Quick) Italian Tomato Sauce for Pasta"},{"location":"sauces/italian_tomato_sauce/#ingredients","text":"4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (like Lucini) 4 or 5 cloves fresh garlic (not in a jar, dried, powdered, or frozen) preferably grown in USA small bunch of fresh Italian parsley, finely chopped (my family likes to use parsley in sugo) 1 (28-32 oz) carton/jar of chopped tomatoes or puree (like Mutti, or Bionaturae\u2013 I no longer like POMI since their tomatoes are no longer good quality) ultimately, chopped fresh Roma tomatoes are best if you have them about 1 1/2 level tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher or sea salt 3 or 4 large leaves of fresh basil Parmigiano Reggiano to grate Note: To obtain a delicious sauce, you need quality ingredients.

Pour 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the large container and give it a few stir. Allow beans to soak overnight for at least 8 - 16 hours. If your house is very warm, place the large container in the fridge to avoid fermentation. Quick Soaking Method: If you're short on time or forgot to soak the beans overnight, you can use this quick soaking method instead. The result will not be as good as the overnight soaking method. Place 1 pound (454g) dried navy beans, 1.5 tbsp (25g) fine table salt, and 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the pressure cooker. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 0 minute + 30 minutes Natural Release. Drain Beans: Discard the soaked water and drain the navy beans through a mesh strainer. Rinse the beans with cold tap water. Drain well. The soaked beans should almost double in weight. Render Bacon: Place chopped bacon in Pressure Cooker and turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press Saut\u00e9 button). Stir occasionally and allow the bacon bits to crisp (~3 mins). Add in diced onion, freshly ground black pepper and saut\u00e9 for a minute. Add in chopped garlic cloves and saut\u00e9 until fragrant (~30 seconds). Create Molasses Mixture: While the bacon is rendering in pressure cooker, combine \u00bc cup (80g) blackstrap molasses, \u00bc cup (60g) maple syrup, 1 tbsp (15ml) light soy sauce, and 1 \u00be cup (438) cold water in a 1L (4 cups) glass measuring cup. Mix well. Deglaze: Pour \u00bd cup (125ml) of the molasses mixture in the Instant Pot. Deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pan and mix them into the mixture. Pressure Cook Navy Beans: Add \u00bc tsp fine table salt, 2 bay leaves, soaked navy beans (889g) and the remaining molasses mixture in the pressure cooker. Mix well and make sure all the beans are submerged in the molasses mixture. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 20 minutes + 20 minutes Natural Release. Important Tip: The pressure cooking time may vary depending on many factors such as the age of beans. If your beans are not fully cooked, simply add pressure cooking time accordingly. For reference, some readers reported their beans need to pressure cook for an extra 15 - 25 mins. After 20 minutes, turn the venting knob to venting position to release the remaining pressure. Open the lid carefully. Season and Thicken Baked Beans: Add 2 tsp (12g) dijon mustard, and 1 tsp (5ml) apple cider vinegar into the cooked baked beans. Mix well. Turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press Saut\u00e9 button) and stir to thicken the baked beans to desired consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding more blackstrap molasses, salt, or vinegar if necessary.

Cook this mixture for about 5 minutes. Once veggies are done, stir in the spinach so that it wilts. Mix well. Remove the filling from heat and put it in a bowl. To fill the potstickers: wet your finger and wet the side of the round wrappers. Scoop about 1 tsp or so of mixture onto the center of the wrapper. Fold the round wrapper over, making it a half circle. Wet your fingers well and press the open edges of the half circle together well. Using the rest of oil, heat the pan on medium and cook it until lightly brown. Flipping over a few times. About 4 total minutes. Serve with a dipping sauce. Dipping sauce Soy sauce or coconut aminos or Tamari (Gluten-free) Rice wine vinegar Maple syrup Chili oil or Sriracha minced garlic cloves or garlic powder sesame oil Mix all ingredients and enjoy. Home-made Potsticker wrappers Original Recipe from The Flavor Bender 285g of all purpose Flour 150-175 ml of boiled water (see note 1 & 2) 1 tsp salt Instructions In a bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Create a well in the middle (like you would when making pasta) Add hot water slowly, while mixing with a wooden spoon until flour forms clumpy bits. You can alternate mixing and pouring water. Knead the dough clumps by hand to form one soft dough ball. If the mix is too dry, add a little more of the water at a time. If the mix is too sticky, add a little flour at a time. Knead the dough further on the work bench for about 2 minutes. Use flour sparingly if the dough is getting sticky. The dough will look smooth at this stage and be a little stretchy/elastic. You can let the dough rest like this in one big ball, or cut it roughly into four equal parts and knead each piece to form a dough ball. Wrap the dough/dough balls tightly in plastic wrap (individually) or place it inside a zip-lock bag and seal it (push out as much air as possible) and let it rest for at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. You can use the dough immediately after it has been rested. If you are using it the next day instead, place the dough in the fridge (sealed in bags) and return it back to room temperature before handling them. Lightly dust your work bench and rolling pin with flour. Roll out each piece of the dough (dusting lightly with flour as needed) as thin as you can. Once the dough has been rolled out, (make sure the dough is not sticking to the counter top), cut out the dumpling wrappers using a round biscuit cutter of 3.5-4 inches in diameter. Re-knead the leftover dough and re-roll it once more (after resting it for 30 minutes at least) to cut out more dumpling wrappers. Use them immediately with your choice of filling. Notes The amount of water changes depending on the brand of the flour and the temperature. Keep an eye out for the right consistency. The common amount of flour to water ratio is roughly 2:1 Boil the water first, and then measure the required amount of water. Do not measure water first and then boil it, as evaporation = less water! If you are stacking the wrappers after cutting them out, they will require flour between each one to prevent sticking.","title":"Mushroom spinach potstickers (Ve, P, GF)"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#mushroom-spinach-potstickers","text":"Original Recipe by Pure Mamas Prep time: 15 minutes || Cook time: 10 minutes || Total time: 25 || Yield: 12","title":"Mushroom Spinach Potstickers"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#ingredients","text":"3.5 oz mushrooms finely chopped (about 2 cups) 1-2 red/orange bell peppers, finely chopped 3 small cloves garlic or 1 large one, pressed or chopped 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil or butter (separate) 1 Tbsp shallots, finely chopped 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped pinch sea salt 1 package of potsticker or gyoza wrappers (or home-made potsticker wrappers recipe below) glass of water to dip your fingers in dipping sauce (recipe below)","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#instructions","text":"In a large frying pan add 1 Tbsp oil (save the other Tbsp for later), mushrooms, bell peppers, garlic and sea salt.

This will help thicken the stew. If the stew is too runny to your liking, add some bisto to thicken it up a bit. Put some cold water in a bowl and mix in the bisto. Then pour it in the stew and stir. Stir in the frozen peas and allow them to heat through. Adjust the seasoning to taste. This astounding stew is a flawless choice for bone-chilling days.","title":"Instructions"}]}
