Pour 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the large container and give it a few stir. Allow beans to soak overnight for at least 8 - 16 hours. If your house is very warm, place the large container in the fridge to avoid fermentation. Quick Soaking Method: If you're short on time or forgot to soak the beans overnight, you can use this quick soaking method instead. The result will not be as good as the overnight soaking method. Place 1 pound (454g) dried navy beans, 1.5 tbsp (25g) fine table salt, and 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the pressure cooker. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 0 minute + 30 minutes Natural Release. Drain Beans: Discard the soaked water and drain the navy beans through a mesh strainer. Rinse the beans with cold tap water. Drain well. The soaked beans should almost double in weight. Render Bacon: Place chopped bacon in Pressure Cooker and turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press Saut\u00e9 button). Stir occasionally and allow the bacon bits to crisp (~3 mins). Add in diced onion, freshly ground black pepper and saut\u00e9 for a minute. Add in chopped garlic cloves and saut\u00e9 until fragrant (~30 seconds).

About 3/4 of an inch in from the root, drive a wooden skewer through the center of the onion. Push the skewer all the way through, so that the flat end of the skewer is next to the onion and the pointy end is as far away from the onion as possible. On one side of the skewer, slice the root end off of the onion. On the other side of the skewer, leaving about 3/4 inch of onion, slice the onion so that the skewer is going through the center of the slice. Use a knife to cut the part of the skewer that is sticking out of the onion. Repeat until both onions have been sliced into even slices, about 3/4 inch thick. Trim the skewers so that there is not excess sticking out of the onion. Brush the slices on both sides with olive oil, season with salt and pepper. - On a charcoal grill: Make a two zone fire - coals on one side and no coals on the other. Place the onions on the cool side of the grill and flip and roate every 10 to 15 minutes until they are golden brown. Onions are done when golden and tender (in about 25-40 minutes) - On a gas grill: Heat the grill for 5-10 minutes. Lower the burners to low and cook the onions on the low burner, flipping every 10 minutes. Onions are done when golden and tender (about 25-40 minutes). Notes: Use sweet onions such as Walla Walla or Vidalia. The sugars in the onion caramelize perfectly. Use wooden skewers. They can be cut to fit the onion, so each onion is skewerd individually. Running the skewer through the center of the onion will keep the tender, middle part of the onion (the best part!) from falling out through the grates. Cook low and slow. If you use high heat the outside of the onion will burn while the inside will be underdone.

Cook this mixture for about 5 minutes. Once veggies are done, stir in the spinach so that it wilts. Mix well. Remove the filling from heat and put it in a bowl. To fill the potstickers: wet your finger and wet the side of the round wrappers. Scoop about 1 tsp or so of mixture onto the center of the wrapper. Fold the round wrapper over, making it a half circle. Wet your fingers well and press the open edges of the half circle together well. Using the rest of oil, heat the pan on medium and cook it until lightly brown. Flipping over a few times. About 4 total minutes. Serve with a dipping sauce.

Home-made Potsticker wrappers Original Recipe from The Flavor Bender 285g of all purpose Flour 150-175 ml of boiled water (see note 1 & 2) 1 tsp salt Instructions In a bowl, mix the flour and salt together. Create a well in the middle (like you would when making pasta) Add hot water slowly, while mixing with a wooden spoon until flour forms clumpy bits. You can alternate mixing and pouring water. Knead the dough clumps by hand to form one soft dough ball. If the mix is too dry, add a little more of the water at a time. If the mix is too sticky, add a little flour at a time. Knead the dough further on the work bench for about 2 minutes. Use flour sparingly if the dough is getting sticky. The dough will look smooth at this stage and be a little stretchy/elastic. You can let the dough rest like this in one big ball, or cut it roughly into four equal parts and knead each piece to form a dough ball. Wrap the dough/dough balls tightly in plastic wrap (individually) or place it inside a zip-lock bag and seal it (push out as much air as possible) and let it rest for at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. You can use the dough immediately after it has been rested. If you are using it the next day instead, place the dough in the fridge (sealed in bags) and return it back to room temperature before handling them. Lightly dust your work bench and rolling pin with flour. Roll out each piece of the dough (dusting lightly with flour as needed) as thin as you can. Once the dough has been rolled out, (make sure the dough is not sticking to the counter top), cut out the dumpling wrappers using a round biscuit cutter of 3.5-4 inches in diameter. Re-knead the leftover dough and re-roll it once more (after resting it for 30 minutes at least) to cut out more dumpling wrappers. Use them immediately with your choice of filling. Notes The amount of water changes depending on the brand of the flour and the temperature. Keep an eye out for the right consistency. The common amount of flour to water ratio is roughly 2:1 Boil the water first, and then measure the required amount of water. Do not measure water first and then boil it, as evaporation = less water! If you are stacking the wrappers after cutting them out, they will require flour between each one to prevent sticking.","title":"Mushroom spinach potstickers"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#mushroom-spinach-potstickers","text":"Original Recipe by Pure Mamas Prep time: 15 minutes || Cook time: 10 minutes || Total time: 25 || Yield: 12","title":"Mushroom Spinach Potstickers"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#ingredients","text":"3.5 oz mushrooms finely chopped (about 2 cups) 1-2 red/orange bell peppers, finely chopped 3 small cloves garlic or 1 large one, pressed or chopped 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil or butter (separate) 1 Tbsp shallots, finely chopped 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped pinch sea salt 1 package of potsticker or gyoza wrappers (or home-made potsticker wrappers recipe below) glass of water to dip your fingers in dipping sauce (recipe below)","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"sides/mushroom_spinach_potstickers/#instructions","text":"In a large frying pan add 1 Tbsp oil (save the other Tbsp for later), mushrooms, bell peppers, garlic and sea salt.
