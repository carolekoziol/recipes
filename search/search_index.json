General Tao Sauce Yield: 4 cups (This seems to be the right amount of sauce for this recipe) Cook Time: 5 \u2013 10 minutes (needs to be watched while cooking) 1 cup ketchup 1/2 cup tamari (substitute soy sauce, or coconut aminos) 1/2 cups water 1/2 cup maple syrup 3 1/2 Tablespoon mirin 2 Tablespoon sesame oil 1 \u00bd Tablespoon rice vinegar 1/3 teaspoon black pepper 1 \u00bd teaspoon sriracha 1 \u00bd teaspoon ginger, minced 1 \u00bd teaspoon garlic, minced For the slurry: 3 Tbsp. cornstarch 3 Tbsp. water Combine all of the ingredients in a pot, except for the slurry ingredients. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring continuously. Do not leave unattended! The sugar can burn easily! Mix the slurry ingredients in a bowl. Keeping the heat on medium high, mix the slurry into the sauce in the pot. Keep stirring the sauce over medium high heat until the mixture bubbles and thickens and the slurry is no longer cloudy in the sauce. The finished sauce should be glossy and thick enough to coat a spoon.

Pour 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the large container and give it a few stir. Allow beans to soak overnight for at least 8 - 16 hours. If your house is very warm, place the large container in the fridge to avoid fermentation. Quick Soaking Method: If you're short on time or forgot to soak the beans overnight, you can use this quick soaking method instead. The result will not be as good as the overnight soaking method. Place 1 pound (454g) dried navy beans, 1.5 tbsp (25g) fine table salt, and 6 cups (1.5L) cold water in the pressure cooker. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 0 minute + 30 minutes Natural Release. Drain Beans: Discard the soaked water and drain the navy beans through a mesh strainer. Rinse the beans with cold tap water. Drain well. The soaked beans should almost double in weight. Render Bacon: Place chopped bacon in Pressure Cooker and turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: press Saut\u00e9 button). Stir occasionally and allow the bacon bits to crisp (~3 mins). Add in diced onion, freshly ground black pepper and saut\u00e9 for a minute. Add in chopped garlic cloves and saut\u00e9 until fragrant (~30 seconds).

Pressure Cook Navy Beans: Add \u00bc tsp fine table salt, 2 bay leaves, soaked navy beans (889g) and the remaining molasses mixture in the pressure cooker. Mix well and make sure all the beans are submerged in the molasses mixture. Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 20 minutes + 20 minutes Natural Release. Important Tip: The pressure cooking time may vary depending on many factors such as the age of beans. If your beans are not fully cooked, simply add pressure cooking time accordingly.

About 3/4 of an inch in from the root, drive a wooden skewer through the center of the onion. Push the skewer all the way through, so that the flat end of the skewer is next to the onion and the pointy end is as far away from the onion as possible. On one side of the skewer, slice the root end off of the onion. On the other side of the skewer, leaving about 3/4 inch of onion, slice the onion so that the skewer is going through the center of the slice. Use a knife to cut the part of the skewer that is sticking out of the onion. Repeat until both onions have been sliced into even slices, about 3/4 inch thick. Trim the skewers so that there is not excess sticking out of the onion. Brush the slices on both sides with olive oil, season with salt and pepper. - On a charcoal grill: Make a two zone fire - coals on one side and no coals on the other. Place the onions on the cool side of the grill and flip and roate every 10 to 15 minutes until they are golden brown. Onions are done when golden and tender (in about 25-40 minutes) - On a gas grill: Heat the grill for 5-10 minutes. Lower the burners to low and cook the onions on the low burner, flipping every 10 minutes. Onions are done when golden and tender (about 25-40 minutes). Notes: Use sweet onions such as Walla Walla or Vidalia. The sugars in the onion caramelize perfectly. Use wooden skewers. They can be cut to fit the onion, so each onion is skewerd individually. Running the skewer through the center of the onion will keep the tender, middle part of the onion (the best part!) from falling out through the grates. Cook low and slow. If you use high heat the outside of the onion will burn while the inside will be underdone. Slice onions into even slices to ensure even cooking.","title":"Grilled Onions"},{"location":"sides/grilled_onions/#grilled-onions","text":"Original Recipe from Fox and Briar Total time: 40 minutes || Serving: 4","title":"Grilled Onions"},{"location":"sides/grilled_onions/#ingredients","text":"2 sweet onions, such as Walla Walla or Vidalia 1 tablespoon olive oil kosher salt fresh ground pepper","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"sides/grilled_onions/#instructions","text":"Hold the onion on a cutting board, with the root end facing sideways.
